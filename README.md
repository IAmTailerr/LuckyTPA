# LuckyTPA
**Simple yet customizable TPA plugin**

This is a basic plugin to use teleporting, you can request to teleport or you can simply teleport to the player without needing to ask.

### Commands

/tpa [player]

> **TPAHERE** will allow you to send a request to teleport another player to you
/tpahere [player]

> **TPACCEPT** will allow you to accept an incoming teleport request
/tpaccept

>**TPDENY** will allow you to deny an incoming teleport request
/tpdeny

> **TP** will allow you to directly teleport to a player without requesting
/tp

> **TPHERE** will allow you to directly teleport a player to you without requesting

Simply just drag & drop the plugin into your plugins folder. Use the permissions at the top of **config.yml** to give your players the correct permissions.

Don't have a permissions plugin? I recommend [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net).
